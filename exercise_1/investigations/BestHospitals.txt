The best hospitals will provide a number of procedures to a large number of people and return the highest scores per procedure.  I simply multiplied the procedure score by the sample size and summed the scores to arrive at a figure that expresses the aggregate quality of service to the widest audience.  I could have (should have) penalized hospitals for return visits, but it was not clear what scale those scores were.
